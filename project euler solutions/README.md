Solutions, in python and haskell, to almost all of the first 82 problems in project euler.

I wasn't sure if I should publish these given people could just download them and advance
in the problem set very fast, but I decided to make them public, so everybody can laught
at how bad I used (and use) to write code in python and haskell.

Anyway if they already decided to just search on the internet for solutions and don't do
the heavy work to learn, well I can do nothing to stop them. (If you intent to advance
fast using these code, well, then you're not only breaking the rules, but you're and
idiot who don't wanna learn, that or, you are very qualified but very very lazy to try to
code some "simple" exercises. Anyways, thanks for visiting, please subscribe and you'll
receive more videos about how to be a jerk!)

Also, some of these solutions require some extra code, if you're willing to make them
work, search in other projects I've done ;).
