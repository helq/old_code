This repository holds some of the code I've written over the years (on my bachelor
studies) and I deemed it too short or simple to publish it when I wrote it (and now that I
read it I feel a little nostalgic, and surprised by how good or na√Øve some of it is).

There is no warranty any of these stuff is well written, complete, useful or in English
for anybody, I don't even warranty an explanation about every piece of code.

I'm just uploading this, for (off course) possible future job interviews ;) (why would
anybody have github/-lab projects public if it wasn't to show off), but principally this
is a repository to hold things so they don't get lost by any failure of my hard disk.

states otherwise.
